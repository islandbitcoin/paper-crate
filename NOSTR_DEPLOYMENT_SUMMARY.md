### Discovery Tags
Your site will be discoverable via these hashtags:
- `#creator-economy` - Primary project tag
- `#nostr` - Nostr protocol tag
- `#bitcoin` - Bitcoin/Lightning tag
- `#lightning` - Lightning Network tag
- `#micropayments` - Micropayment functionality
- `#influencer-marketing` - Marketing category
- `#social-media` - Social media category

### Site Metadata
